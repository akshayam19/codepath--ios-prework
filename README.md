## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Instagram 
    - Love to look at new content every time I open up the app
    - Able to make a story (displayed on profile page) you can add pictures to and look back at later 
2. Snapchat
    - Exploring the various filters that are constantly changing
    - Feels like having kind of a face to face convo as you can write on snaps and reply in the same manner
    - Can see people's birthdays if you ever forget
3. Google Calendar
    - Helps me see all the events I have for the month or week or day in a nice visualization
    - Lets me put reminders and send invites to others 
    
Idea: I have seen that there is no ideal application for housing search and leasing on the Ohio State campus. I would like to create an app that combines all the different house owners and respective house showings so students don't have to go to their indiviudal websites and keep a track on the houses. This would also allow tenants to find people to sublease and vice versa all in one place. Features may include filters types of housing companies, chatting with current tenants for subleasing, seeing all houses on a map.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was unable to find a few features on the Xcode application as it was my first time using the IDE and swift. However, I used CodePath slack as a resource to ask any questions are recieve some help. 

I also added a feature where the color of the text also change when you click the button and used some different fonts that are not default.
